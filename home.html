            In order to demonstrate the workings of the OneSignal Web SDK, I have set up a small trial site which utilises each of
            Web SDK methods and gives the code used for each of these methods.
            <br><br>
            Each method will be accompanied by a bried explanation of how the method works and some common use cases, as well as a 
            link to the official OneSignal documentation for the method.
