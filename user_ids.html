        <div id="article_body">
            Within OneSignal there are two types of User IDs: 
            <div id="subtitle">Player IDs</div>
            Player Ids are created when a user registers and will remain the same for as long as the user is subscribed to notifications. 
            When a user resets their notification settings and clears their borwser's site data for your site, they will need to reregister 
            to recieve notifications. Doing so will create a new player ID, but will not delete the old player ID (which will now be set to 
            "Not Subscribed") within the Audience -> Users page of the OneSignal platform. 
            <br><br> 
            To retrieve the user's player ID, you will need to run the following command:
            <br><br><br>
            <div class="code_box">
                OneSignal.push(function() {
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;/* These examples are all valid */
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OneSignal.getUserId(function(userId) {
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("OneSignal User ID:", userId);
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// (Output) OneSignal User ID: 270a35cd-4dda-4b3f-b04e-41d7463a2316    
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;});
                <br>});
            </div>
            <br><br>
            If you have subscribed, your current player ID will be displayed in the box below:
            <div class="code_box" id="player_id"></div>
        </div>

    </div>
    <script>
    OneSignal = parent.OneSignal;
    OneSignal.push(function() {
        OneSignal.getUserId(function(userId) {
            if(userId){
                document.getElementById("player_id").innerHTML = userId;
            }  
        });
    });
    </script>
</body>
