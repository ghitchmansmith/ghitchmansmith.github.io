            Within OneSignal there are two types of User IDs: 
            <div id="subtitle">Player IDs</div>
            Player Ids are created when a user registers and will remain the same for as long as the user is subscribed to notifications. 
            When a user resets their notification settings and clears their borwser's site data for your site, they will need to reregister 
            to recieve notifications. Doing so will create a new player ID, but will not delete the old player ID (which will now be set to 
            "Not Subscribed") within the Audience -> Users page of the OneSignal platform.
